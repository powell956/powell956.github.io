This list assumes that you have already googled your problem, and that you will google unfamiliar concepts and methods as they arise. At this point, it is non-advice.

1. Make sure you’re solving the right problem
    * Do you fully understand what is being asked of you?
    * Did you miss some subtlety in the instructions you were given?
2. Work out exactly what your code is actually doing and write it down. This goes hand-in-hand with using debugging and testing tools, like rspec and pry—which you should already be doing! (stuck or not)
    * All too often, what your code is doing and what you think it is doing are very different things.
    * Add some comments in your code demystifying:
        *  the contents of data structures
        * ambiguous variables
        * loop paths
        * unfamiliar methods
3. Reference the plan for solving your problem that you so cleverly and responsibly wrote out before getting down to the essential tasks
    * Where can you add comments in your code that will map out your plan in the code?
    * Take advantage of the the checkbox functionality (syntax: `- [ ]` <= note the spaces) in markdown (.md) files’ previews (in atom: cntrl + cmd + m)
4. “…reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started.
   Reduce the problem to something simpler. Instead of the third-highest number, what about finding the highest overall? Still too tough? What about finding the largest of just three numbers? Or the larger of two?"
5. Draw a visual representation of what your code is doing.
 In fact, go head and make diagramming, or modeling, should already be a part of your planning process.
(If you don’ draw good, don’t worry about it—odds are, at any given moment you're "in good company")
6. Grab your favorite rubber duck—whether it’s a desktop decoration, pet, or saintly patient friend.
Obviously, the quality of your rubber duck decoding session will correlate with the level of consciousness of your audience, but we make do; we make do.
7. Step away
    * Look at something other than your computer screen, preferably nothing, to allow your brain space to expand out of the myopic state of mind you’ll inevitably find yourself experiencing when you code.
    * Most people think programming looks like spending hours at a time staring at your computer’s screen, hopefully with your fingers moving on the keyboard. What effective programming actually looks like is screen time for a while, getting up and stretching or taking a walk, repeat.
8. Open a new tab or window in your text editor or development environment, and start over completely.
    * This trick is especially helpful for coders battling ADD, experiencing ego death while looking at a wall of text.
    * I add it as a last resort, because it can only be applied to small problems and takes a bit longer to execute than the above tricks.
